### Meeting ~ (25.02.2020, 30 min)
****
**Present:** Metehan Saçakçı, Erengazi Mutlu, İlke Doğan, Hacı Çakın, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer

**Discussion:** 
This week we generally talk about our project's main aims and its priorities such as what our aim is and what should we focus on more. At this point, we have ideas about what adjustments should we offer to the users such as electricity controls, water controls, etc. Also, whether we are not quite sure about which platforms should we use for our project, we concluded that pc interface and GUI which is coded on Java probably will be our first step. Next week, we are planning to discuss possible attributes and basic design of our pc interface.

**ToDo:** All group members mainly will search about what programs should we use for pc interface. Also, for next week every member need to contribute to the project with new ideas or potential interface designs which can more differ our Smart Home project from other usual ones and make it more unique.

### Meeting ~ (05.03.2020, 40 min)
****
**Present:** Metehan Saçakçı, Erengazi Mutlu, İlke Doğan, Hacı Çakın, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer

**Discussion:** 
This week we come out with new interface designs that are drawn on papers and discussed which of them is more suitable for our projects. When we are thinking the idea that comes to our mind is that our project can offer different interface designs to different aged people. As an example, user who is old probably prefers to use a program which contains large buttons and simple panels which make it easier to understands. Our current drawings will help us to design our interfaces in next weeks. Also, another fact that we realize that our current notes contain mobile phone interface designs. This situation lets us think that rather than just work on pc interface we also should focus on to create a mobile app for the achieve Smart Home project. Rather than, at this point, we concluded that for our pc designs mainly designed with two different programs. One of them is used to write and design the codes. Other one is basically used to design the interface. However, because we do not have enough experience about GUI design we concluded that we should start to search about it. In that way, we will able to start to construct our project.

**ToDo:** Metehan Saçakçı, Hacı Çakın, İlke Doğan should start to watch videos about the pc interface design. Erengazi Mutlu, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer should start to watch videos about how we can write mobile application.

****
**Present:** Metehan Saçakçı, Erengazi Mutlu, İlke Doğan, Hacı Çakın, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer

**Discussion:** 
This week because of the covid-19, we meet on the zoom platform first time. After our last meeting, everyone in our group accepted that he / she has some fundamental opinions about pc and android interface. That is why, at this point, we decided to design two different interfaces. One of them is designed for pc and the other one is designed for the android. Also, to prevent any kind of program version problems we decided use specific versions of jre and jdk. After this meeting, pc interface is started to designed with using Scene Builder and Intellij. We are planning to design mobile application with Android Studio. At the same time, we agreed that for real-time works of smart home we should start Arduino infrastructure and searching libraries, sensors, protocols should be started.This week, we will simply observe our processes and next week when we meet again, we will talk about our suggestions. 

**ToDo:** Metehan Saçakçı, Hacı Çakın, İlke Doğan should start to work on pc interface design and Arduino platform design. Erengazi Mutlu, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer should start to work on the mobile application.

### Meeting ~ (28.03.2020, 60 min)
****

**Present:** Metehan Saçakçı, Erengazi Mutlu, İlke Doğan, Hacı Çakın, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer

**Discussion:** 
This week every group member mentioned his/her's ideas about should we continue to work on our project with last week's plan or not. At this point, whether we do not have displayable interface design on our project files, everyone in the group wants to continue to work with last week's same ToDo list. Interfaces and embedded systems that were learned and created in a week were shared among group members. Ideas were thought about new systems that could be added and additions were made. For example, as a group, to make our smart home functional and equipped, we discussed that we should add different systems like greenhouses and aquariums in our smart home system. We concluded to continue our work with same plan for one more week and for any problem we might face we kept our contact.

**ToDo:** Metehan Saçakçı, Hacı Çakın, İlke Doğan should continue to work on pc interface design Arduino platform design. Erengazi Mutlu, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer should start to work on the mobile application.

### Meeting ~ (17.03.2020, 60 min)
****

**Present:** Metehan Saçakçı, Erengazi Mutlu, İlke Doğan, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer

**Discussion:** 
Hacı was absent because of illness. We discussed what we found, our suggestions. Our main target was that how we can come forward other smart home products. Then we decided to go over this subject. We shared our design ideas. Moreover, we started to think specificially how to build for functionally. All groups members will start to think what we can add more than what we though at the beginning of the idea. Also we started to build applications. We discussed that searching from internet about smart home systems that are done by some of compaines should be done to get impression regarding similar systems. Due to covid'19, we think that, to show our system works properly, we should use virtual simulation on Protues. We think that, it's digital design should be created and sensors that has been searched and chosen will be added. However, we also have some concerns about how to connect embedded system and interfaces. We concluded to continue our work with same plan for one more week and for any problem we might face we kept our contact. 

**ToDo:** Metehan Saçakçı, Hacı Çakın, İlke Doğan should continue to work on pc interface design Arduino and Proteus platform design. Erengazi Mutlu, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer should start to work on the mobile application.

**Present:** Metehan Saçakçı, Erengazi Mutlu, İlke Doğan, Hacı Çakın, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer

**Discussion:** 
This week we searched about what we found. We decided to adjust colors according to human psychology. Also we decided to add sound mode which can be very useful some user. Different choices for users regarding background is discussed and the idea is added to our to do list. Also, Hacı shared an idea of adding voice support system to the pc interface and we discussed how we can do this. We did research on how to add this from websites and decided to create and upload the audio files for each language and each command separately. Replacement suggestions were made for the sensors to be used in Arduino, and it was decided that new systems should be added to Proteus.
Moreover, we showed what we did for application building. We gave suggestions to each other about design. All groups members will continue to work on application building. And both android group and pc user interface, embedded system group will discuss amongst themselves.

**ToDo:** Metehan Saçakçı, Hacı Çakın, İlke Doğan should continue to work on pc interface and Embedded system design. Erengazi Mutlu, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer should start to work on the mobile application.

****
**Present:** Metehan Saçakçı, İlke Doğan,Hacı Çakın

**Discussion:** 
We decided to what we can for pc user interface. We decided to add elder part.We discussed that who will weigh more where. However, we said that each member should help each other. According to we decided to separate three main part. Elder part, main part, proteus and arduino part. We thought that doing a job division could improve our project better. Hacı and İlke shared their opinions on how to establish the communication between the interface and the embedded system and how the protocol should be. Topics such as how to add aquarium and greenhouse to smart home, how to make theme and design were discussed. 

Android----------
We concluded to continue our work with same plan for one more week and for any problem we might face we kept our contact.

They show their work to the other gruop members. We discussed new libraries and applications we used. Some of group members share their research and they advice several websites to the other group members. Project design in Github is discussed and the way use it properly is talked. This is concept is actually useful for us because to integrate our codes we talked we can add this to github and connections can be done easily. We talked that every group member should start to fill their log files and the meeting should be added to the github file in the proper type and we think that we should start to fill our READ.me files. We again discussed, how can we improve our system and also new features that are added.
