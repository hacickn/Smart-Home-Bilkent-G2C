**Present:** Metehan Saçakçı, Erengazi Mutlu, İlke Doğan, Hacı Çakın, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer

**Discussion:** 
This week we generally talk about our project's main aims and its priorities such as what our aim is and what should we focus on more. At this point, we have ideas about what adjustments should we offer to the users such as electricity controls, water controls, etc. Also, whether we are not quite sure about which platforms should we use for our project, we concluded that pc interface and GUI which is coded on Java probably will be our first step. Next week, we are planning to discuss possible attributes and basic design of our pc interface.

**ToDo:** All group members mainly will search about what programs should we use for pc interface. Also, for next week every member need to contribute to the project with new ideas which can more differ our Smart Home project from other usual ones and make it more unique.
