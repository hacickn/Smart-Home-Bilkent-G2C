### Meeting ~ (25.02.2020, 30 min)
****
**Present:** Metehan Saçakçı, Erengazi Mutlu, İlke Doğan, Hacı Çakın, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer

**Discussion:** 
This week we generally talk about our project's main aims and its priorities such as what our aim is and what should we focus on more. At this point, we have ideas about what adjustments should we offer to the users such as electricity controls, water controls, etc. Also, whether we are not quite sure about which platforms should we use for our project, we concluded that pc interface and GUI which is coded on Java probably will be our first step. Next week, we are planning to discuss possible attributes and basic design of our pc interface.

**ToDo:** All group members mainly will search about what programs should we use for pc interface. Also, for next week every member need to contribute to the project with new ideas or potential interface designs which can more differ our Smart Home project from other usual ones and make it more unique.

**Present:** Metehan Saçakçı, Erengazi Mutlu, İlke Doğan, Hacı Çakın, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer

**Discussion:** 
This week we come out with new interface designs that are drawn on papers and discussed which of them is more suitable for our projects. When we are thinking the idea that comes to our mind is that our project can offer different interface designs to different aged people. As an example, user who is old probably prefers to use a program which contains large buttons and simple panels which make it easier to understands. Our current drawings will help us to design our interfaces in next weeks. Also, another fact that we realize that our current notes contain mobile phone interface designs. This situation lets us think that rather than just work on pc interface we also should focus on to create a mobile app for the achieve Smart Home project. Rather than, at this point, we concluded that for our pc designs mainly designed with two different programs. One of them is used to write and design the codes. Other one is basically used to design the interface. However, because we do not have enough experience about GUI design we concluded that we should start to search about it. In that way, we will able to start to construct our project.

**ToDo:** Metehan Saçakçı, Hacı Çakın, İlke Doğan should start to watch videos about the pc interface design. Erengazi Mutlu, Tarık Karalı, Nasuh Dinçer should start to watch videos about how we can write mobile application.
