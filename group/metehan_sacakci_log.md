On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week I started to work about our project's pc interface. My aim is design a special interface for elder people. I basically design first panel of the elderMainPanel. I completed the basic labels that shows time, date and the welcome message. Also, I wrote required methods to control these labels and the first panel's buttons.

After I completed the elder interface's first panel, I started to design "house menu" panel which make it possible for user to control house's specific attributes such as aquarium, electricity control. As a group, before we start to learn how to connect pc interface with simulation, I would like to be sure about elder interface's "house menu" panel should work properly. Whether I am not 100% sure about the "house panel"s appearance, I believe that it is functional and next week probably that appearance problem will be solved.

This week I decided and applied the design of the "house panel"s appearance. I also design "settings panel" appearance and whether it is not functional at this point, it has a proper interface. The current problem about the "settings panel" is that I need to determine and design its function. Next week, I will design the "user" panel which give freedom to user to edit he's or she's username, password, name, surname, birthday, gender, etc.
