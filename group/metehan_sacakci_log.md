On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 03.04.2020 ~
This week I started to work about our project's pc interface. My aim is design a special interface for elder people. I basically design first panel of the elderMainPanel. I completed the basic labels that shows time, date and the welcome message. Also, I wrote required methods to control these labels and the first panel's buttons.

### ~ 09.04.2020 ~
After I completed the elder interface's first panel, I started to design "house menu" panel which make it possible for user to control house's specific attributes such as aquarium, electricity control. As a group, before we start to learn how to connect pc interface with simulation, I would like to be sure about elder interface's "house menu" panel should work properly. Whether I am not 100% sure about the "house panel"s appearance, I believe that it is functional and next week probably that appearance problem will be solved. 

### ~ 16.04.2020 ~
This week I decided and applied the design of the "house panel"s appearance. I also design "settings panel" appearance and whether it is not functional at this point, it has a proper interface. The current problem about the "settings panel" is that I need to determine and design its function. Next week, I will design the "user" panel which give freedom to user to edit he's or she's username, password, name, surname, birthday, gender, etc. 

### ~ 24.04.2020 ~
This week I succesfully design the "user" panel and finished it. At this point, our current "elderMainPanel" which is the interface for elder people is mostly designed but still I have not finished "settings panel" properly. The another problem that I need to fix is to investigate my java code and make it more well designed as much as possible. Next week, I will learn how I can connect this interface with simulation.

### ~ 02.05.2020 ~
This week I realized that Elder Main Panel has crucial problems about code efficiency. That is why I mostly worked to solve this problem and now I believe that Elder Panel has more efficient well proper methods and variables. Also, I mostly finished the code which is written to give functionality to settings pane. Whether there are still settings pane's sub panes that are needed to be completed, I believe that next week I will complete that part. Lastly, I add English and Turkish language choice for the user but again that method has a problem and next week, I will able the solve that problem. 

### ~ 10.05.2020 ~
This week I successfully completed the elder panel's emergency, notification, connection and language panes which are sub panes of the setting pane. At this point, all of these panes' designs and code structures are mostly finished. Also, I fixed the language code problem and now we have more efficient language method to change program's language. Next week I will mainly focus on the house attributes to connect them with the simulation. After connection codes are written and designed, I will start to start to investigate all my code so far and I will make it better my code writing as much as possible.

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
This week I tried my best to understand how I can send messages to ardunio and thanks to my group members, I understand most part of it and I completed elder panels house settings and their connection with the simulation. Other than that, I tried to detect and fix every kind of design problem. I mostly arrange labels' and buttons' size and positions. At this point, it can be assumed that elder panel is mostly finished. Now I will focus on our project's final video until 20.05.2020.
