This week me and my android group had a discussion about which layout we were going to use. We had two at the time, so we decided to have only one and give are full concentration to that. Before that we agreed on to understand the android studio better, we should create an (atleast a simple one) on our own to see how we doing. In that process we give feedback to eachother to find the areas that we should improve.

Through these ten days, I tried to implement and design the settings, some home utilities such as Electricity, Garden Light, Weather popup, door sign and a profile card. I also added pop ups for the settings part to give a user better feeling of the interface. Settings includes two parts one is for the adjusting home settings, one is for the app. To implement pop ups I watched some youtube videos on the internet and implemented it on the app.

Today I uploaded the profile card and some app settings features on github.
