This week me and my android group had a discussion about which layout we were going to use. We had two at the time, so we decided to have only one and give are full concentration to that.
### ~ 10 may 2020 ~
Through these ten days, I tried to implement and design the settings, some home utilities such as Electricity, Garden Light, Weather popup, door sign and a profile card. I also added pop ups for the settings part to give a user better feeling of the interface. Settings includes two parts one is for the adjusting home settings, one is for the app.
