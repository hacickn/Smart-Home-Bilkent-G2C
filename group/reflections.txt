G2C-SMART HOME 

	Thanks to this project, we experienced lots of new things. We learnt embedded systems, databases and their relations.
More important, we learnt how should work on a project as a group. In this project, we also used different ways to 
get knowledge. We watched videos, read the sources, search the websites and we examined the codes of other people.
We saw the advantages and disadvantages of these ways. For example, videos seem to be more practical but we think
searching and reading are more permanent. As a group, we think that the most important benefit of this project is 
that we learnt the relations of some technologies and now thanks to this, we can draw out path in computer science
(at least some of us). Before the this project we even don't know which program will we use to make
java program for pc(In presentation at the beginning of the semester,we wrote Visual Studio which not support java).
However, when we made searchs about it we discovered we should use IntelliJ(also there were other alternatives which
are netbeans,eclipse...). This one is simplest example. We try to say that we are very stranger to computer 
technologies. Now, we know which technologies for which platform and how they work. Because we are familier with
computer technologies, we better understand what we want. For example, one of us started to learn node.js which is
very powerful technology for server side. One of us will start to work on machine learning and go deeper. Of course
these ideas can be changed in time. However the main point is that if we are not familier with these technologies,
we can not think them. This project taught us to open up to the universe of computer technologies and how to discover
them. After this we will continue to discover on our own. Moreover, we have become more knowledgeable about the 
technologies we used(Java-Javafx-Android-Arduino-Relational Databases(SQL)-Firabases-Libraries-MavenLibraries
APIs etc.). We learnt lots of new terms and what they mean.

	There is no big problem about the project. If Covid 19 situation did not happen, maybe communication could 
be better. We could meet and we could write code together. The difficult aspect of our project is writing code
systematic and proper. Because we wrote codes when we had continued to learn. Therefore, in some points, we wrote
codes little bit silly. We regulated after finished but It took times. Therefore, if we made it again, we definetly
would take care of it.
