### ~ 02.03.2020 ~
This I searched smart home technologies, what people don't like about smart home. I also consult some people who are took cs102 in previous years. We worked on Requirements Report.(4-5 hours)

### ~ 09.03.2020 ~
This week I searched some technologies which we can use in our project. I found Javafx whose visuality is great. In order to use javaFx more efficient, I setup some libraries([JFoenix](https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix)) and program ( [Scene Builder](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/javafxscenebuilder-info-2157684.html)). Moreover I found some useful researches to watch. These are from [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/). I also found some useful documents to view when I stack. These are [geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [stack over flow](https://stackoverflow.com/).(10 hours) 

---

### ~ 16.03.2020 ~
This week I started to watch videos about usage of Javafx and SceneBuilder from [udemy java course for javafx](https://www.udemy.com/course/sifirdan-zirveye-adim-adim-bol-uygulamali-java-kursu/) and [arduino course](https://www.udemy.com/course/android-mobil-uygulama-gelistirme-egitimi-java). I also watched some useful videos from youtube about some specified parts of javafx to learn better. The another reason of this is that these udemy courses had missing some parts(for example udemy courses didn't mention all components of javafx such as tab pane, slider, time picker). I also viewed source code of examples of javafx.(nearly estimation 40-50 hours)

---

### ~ 23.03.2020 ~
This week I started to build a demo for pc user interface. I did it for strengthening what I learn until this date. It also gave chance to understand which parts should I do more practise. When I was stack some parts, I searched how can fix it from websites. I also learnt how I should use css files properly from the codes of example usage. I started the search database technologies. I realized that vectors are very useful to use in project to increase visuality however most of vectors are protected and bought by money. At the beginning of my first demo I used different websites to find proper vectors. Then I found [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) which is free. I also continued to watch android studio course and I can build login screen in android studio. I also searched some researches for our User Interface Desing Report. I found that color has very big impact on people behaviour.Moreover, people are happier when they live with the color which is chosen by them. Therefore I decided to put themes our user interface (nearly estimation 70-80 hours)

---

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week I finished pc user interface demo. It has user profile, menu, setting and statistic parts( We didn't upload this demo but If you want I can upload it. In other word, I can show it). This demo was very good practise for me. After the group meeting, I start to build new one for Cs102 project which is more tidy.  Before this I showed my first project to get feedback. I paid attention what people say about my first demo. I found suitable database technologies for us. In our project sqlite will be enough. I tried to setup sqlite to my first demo and It worked. I also viewed some documents from [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) to learn sql to use sqlite. I also tried to use mysql for my personal interest. In order to use mysql, I tried various online database services like amazon. However, I can't create connection with online database. After the lost of work, I decided to continue my way.(nearly estimation 20-30 hours)

---

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I discovered [amazon polly speech](https://aws.amazon.com/tr/polly/) , when I tried to create online server for my node.js work. Then I decided to add voices to our project because these sounds were amazing. I finished menu and user profile. Settings were almost done. I also added theme option. I continued to watch android studio and finished nearly. I also created user databases using sqlite and connect it to our user interface.(nearly estimation 20-30 hours)

---

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week I finished setting page. I also searched online API for which helps to improve out project. Actually, I found an API that is speech-synthesis. I added this features,but It was online therefore It was not useful for pc user interface. It more suitable for android part. I added language options both text and sounds. I show my project some people again. According to their usage I adjust sound mode and some visual things. I started to think about how we connect our GUI to embedded system.  (nearly estimation 10-20 hours)

---

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week I found great [API](https://weatherstack.com/) which give weather forecast according to our input. I discovered this API, when I worked on my [node.js course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/). First, I wrote it in node.js then I decided to add it our java project.
In node.js there is already jsonparser however in java there is not. I consulted my TA Sevil Çalışkan and and decided to parse json file like as we did in HTMLReader Lab. Anyway I searched and found some java jsonparse libraries but I didn't use them. I also thinking about our detail design and I started to write some of these classes. (nearly estimation 10-20 hours)

---

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week I nearly finished my parts of work. We created connection between embedded system and java user interface successfully. I also wrote all my parts of class in both arduino and java. Next week, I will fix bugs as much as I can.(nearly estimation 20 hours)

---

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week, I continuied to fix some bugs and tried to make pc user interface more user friendly. For example, when user open and login application, he has to wait response from weather service. In this part GUI is frozen. In order to prevent this, I searched how can preven it. Then I learnt threads in java udemy course. I applied it my javafx application. However, it doesn't work. Then I searched why it didn't worked. I learnt that javafx need some extra codes. I also added two new themes for pc user interface. I embedded fonts which are used in user interface to program.  I added weather api to android project and I created weather activity to show user weather information. I also added chart library and two chart to android project. I started to make uml diagram because our project almost done.(nearly 40 hours)

---

### ~ 11.05.2020 ~
This week I added javadocs and I will add comments. We also finished detail design. I made uml diagram of pc user interface. This week we will contiune to find bugs and fix them. Last week, I allocated my time to find bugs and nonsense points. I made a list which has 25 different little bugs(from font size to adding new user). I fixed all these bugs. After this point, I added 3 more theme and 2 more language(both sound and in text). I also added new fonts. I embedded them in the program because otherwise fonts can change computer to computer(Last week I tried the program's jar version on my father computer.There are some differences between what I did and What I saw. Font was one of them.Therefore to fix it, I embedded fonts to program). Not only fonts, but also there were some görünüşsel differences. I fixed them. I also added a method that regulate string to make it suitable for request.(nearly 30 hours) 

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
This week I will work on only project video. I also fixed some little bugs. I adjust pc user interface part in detail desing's second report.(nearly 15 hours)

> What I did until now
```
* I made menu pane which has home facilities panes( Electricity - gas -  water - greenhouse - 
garden light - aquarium - shortcuts - time configuration ).
* I made login panel of user interface.
* I added user profile.
* I added 3 language option( both sound and text ).
* I added 9 theme, program have totaly 12 theme( 3 of them are added by İlke Doğan).
* I added emergency pane which gives chance to make buzzers active manuelly.
* I added notification pane that warns user in emergency situation.
* I added connection setting pane that gives chance to choose which type connection will be.
* I added users pane(add new user pane, remove user pane, permissions pane) that controls adding ,
removing user and permission for child access
* I added mods pane that controls the sound and text mode
* I added home settings pane that give chance to view usages of sources(electricity and gas usage),
statistic about greenhouse values(temperature,humidity) 
and set the aquarium settings and weather preferences.
* I added weather pane which is gave current weather forecast( İlke Doğan aided to me to add 
background walpaper).
* More things which are added from me about program logic can be found in pc user interface
report which is in detailed folder.
* I wrote these classes in java pc user interface; Aquarium.java, Abstract.java, 
Communication.java, Arduino.java, CommonSetting.java, Usage.java, User.java, 
CommonSettingData.java, DatabaseConnection.java,ElectricityUsage.java,
GasUsage.java, Users.java, Main.java, WeatherForecast.java
* I wrote these controllers in java pc user interface; MainPanel.java, LoginPanel.java
* I worte these views in java pc user interface(I built in scene builder); mainPanel.fxml,
loginPanel.fxml
* I also added nearly all images in images folder.( ilke doğan has helped to me in weather 
and theme backgorund images)
* I added all sound files in music folder.
* I added all language properties in language folder( Metehan Saçakçı also added some
words in these properties).
* I also added totalty 10 css file for themes(in program we have 15 css file. 4 of them are 
added by İlke Doğan and 1 one fo them is added by Metehan Saçakçı).
* I added fonts that are used in program to embed the system.
* I creates all database tables; ELECTRICITY TABLE, FISHES TABLE, GAS TABLE, GREENHOUSE TABLE,
HOME TABLE, USERS TABLE.
* I added WeatherForecast.java in android app to get weather from the Internet.
* I added chart library and two chart to android app.
* I also wrote Smart_App_Cnt , hours_setting parts of the Arduino code.
* In proteus, I made Gas_Valve, electricity_relay, water_valve parts( İlke Doğan aided to me).
* I added two more language.
* I added input regulater in order to prevent to recieve error response. In server request all
characters should be suitable for request string. However, some cities has characters which are
not suitable for this. Therefore, My method regulates according to request criteria.(Ç,Ş.. etc).
```

> What will we do?( We will do them in the summer )
```
* We fixed all bugs which we can find but most probably there will be lots of bugs which we cannot 
realize at this point.Therefore, as the bugs come out, we will continue to fix them.
* We also want to synchronize android app and pc application.
* We will learn and add IoT and AI things(But we cannot find a way that we should follow 
for these fields. If you have suggestions for these fields, please inform us :) ).
* In order to make our project more funtional, I will finish node.js. I already learnt %50
of the course. Node.js helps us in backhand side. When we synchronize, It will have a very important
role at this stage.
```
> Note: I want to add one more facts about this project. When I was working on this project, I discovered lots of technologies and infrmation. But main contribution of this project is none of them. In this project, I understood that, I'm in right palace where I should be. I discovered that I enjoy so much when I spend my time my time with coding and discovering new things. After the this project, I create a way in my mind which I follow to learn such technologies. I do not know how many point we will get but I know that this project trigger me to understand that I'm very happy with what I did for this project. Thanks for everything teacher. I just wanted to said these words because of my happiness
