On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 02.03.2020 ~
This week I learn xyz and worked out...

### ~ 09.03.2020 ~
This week I searched some technologies which we can use in our project. I found Javafx whose visuality is great. In order to use javaFx more efficient, I setup some libraries([JFoenix](https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix)) and program ( [Scene Builder](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/javafxscenebuilder-info-2157684.html)). Moreover I found some useful researches to watch. These are from [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/). I also found some useful documents to view when I stack. These are [geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [stack over flow](https://stackoverflow.com/). 

### ~ 16.03.2020 ~
This week I started to watch videos about usage of Javafx and SceneBuilder from [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/sifirdan-zirveye-adim-adim-bol-uygulamali-java-kursu/) and [onether course](https://www.udemy.com/course/android-mobil-uygulama-gelistirme-egitimi-java). I also watched some useful videos from youtube about some specified parts of javafx to learn better. The another reason of this is that these udemy courses had missing some parts(for example udemy courses didn't mention all components of javafx such as tab pane, slider, time picker). I also viewed source code of examples of javafx.

### ~ 23.03.2020 ~
This week I started to build a demo for pc user interface. I did do that for strengthening what I learn until this date. It also gave chance to understand which parts should I do more practise. When I was stack some parts, I searched how can fix it from websites. I also learnt how I should use css files properly from the codes of example usage. I started the search database technologies. I realized that vectors are very useful to use in project to increase visuality however most of vectors are protected and bought by money. At the beginning of my first demo I used different websites to find proper vectors. Then I found [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) which is free. I also continued to watch android studio course and I can build login screen in android studio. 

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week I finished pc user interface demo. After the group meeting I start to build new one for Cs102 project.  Before this I show my first project to get feedback. I took careful what people say about my first demo. I found suitable database technologies for us. In our project sqlite will be enough. I tried to setup sqlite to my first demo and It worked. I also viewed some documents from [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) to learn sql to use sqlite. I also tried to use mysql for my personal interest. In order to use mysql, I tried various online database services like amazon. However, I can't create connection with online database. After the lost of work, I decided to continue my way.
