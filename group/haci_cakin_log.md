On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 02.03.2020 ~
This week I learn xyz and worked out...

### ~ 09.03.2020 ~
This week I searched some technologies which we can use in our project. I found Javafx whose visuality is great. In order to use javaFx more efficient, I setup some libraries([JFoenix](https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix)) and program ( [Scene Builder](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/javafxscenebuilder-info-2157684.html)). Moreover I found some useful researches to watch. These are from [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/). I also found some useful documents to view when I stack. These are [geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [stack over flow](https://stackoverflow.com/).(10 hours) 

### ~ 16.03.2020 ~
This week I started to watch videos about usage of Javafx and SceneBuilder from [udemy java course for javafx](https://www.udemy.com/course/sifirdan-zirveye-adim-adim-bol-uygulamali-java-kursu/) and [arduino course](https://www.udemy.com/course/android-mobil-uygulama-gelistirme-egitimi-java). I also watched some useful videos from youtube about some specified parts of javafx to learn better. The another reason of this is that these udemy courses had missing some parts(for example udemy courses didn't mention all components of javafx such as tab pane, slider, time picker). I also viewed source code of examples of javafx.(nearly estimation 40-50 hours)

### ~ 23.03.2020 ~
This week I started to build a demo for pc user interface. I did it for strengthening what I learn until this date. It also gave chance to understand which parts should I do more practise. When I was stack some parts, I searched how can fix it from websites. I also learnt how I should use css files properly from the codes of example usage. I started the search database technologies. I realized that vectors are very useful to use in project to increase visuality however most of vectors are protected and bought by money. At the beginning of my first demo I used different websites to find proper vectors. Then I found [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) which is free. I also continued to watch android studio course and I can build login screen in android studio.(nearly estimation 70-80 hours)

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week I finished pc user interface demo. After the group meeting I start to build new one for Cs102 project.  Before this I show my first project to get feedback. I paid attention what people say about my first demo. I found suitable database technologies for us. In our project sqlite will be enough. I tried to setup sqlite to my first demo and It worked. I also viewed some documents from [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) to learn sql to use sqlite. I also tried to use mysql for my personal interest. In order to use mysql, I tried various online database services like amazon. However, I can't create connection with online database. After the lost of work, I decided to continue my way.(nearly estimation 20-30 hours)

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I discovered amazon polly speech, when I tried to create online server for my node.js work. Then I decided to add voices to our project because these sounds were amazing. I finished menu and user profile. Settings were almost done. I also added theme option. I continued to watch android studio and finished nearly. I also created user databases using sqlite and connect it to our user interface.(nearly estimation 20-30 hours)

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week I finished setting page. I also searched online API for which helps to improve out project. I added language options both text and sounds. I show my project some people again. According to their usage I adjust sound mode and some visual things. I started to think about how we connect our GUI to embedded system.  (nearly estimation 10-20 hours)

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week I found great API which give weather forecast according to our input. I discovered this API, when I worked on my [node.js course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/). First, I wrote it in node.js then I decided to add it our java project.
In node.js there is already jsonparser however in java there is not. I consulted my TA Sevil Çalışkan and and decided to parse json file like as we did in HTMLReader Lab. Anyway I searched and found some java jsonparse libraries but I didn't use them. I also thinking about our detail design and I started to write some of these classes. (nearly estimation 10-20 hours)

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week I nearly finished my parts of work. We created connection between embedded system and java user interface successfully. I also wrote all my parts of class. Next week, I will fix bugs as much as I can.(nearly estimation 20 hours)
